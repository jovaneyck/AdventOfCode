# Getting started with F#

Those magical ```.fsx``` files are F# script files.
You can open them in a good old Visual Studio IDE, select the code you want to execute and press ALT+ENTER.

For those of you lucky enough to NOT have Visual Studio installed, there are alternatives on how to work with F# code. Please consult [fsharpforfunandprofit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/installing-and-using/).

My personal recommendations to work with F# would be (in order): [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) with the [SublimeREPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL) plugin.
